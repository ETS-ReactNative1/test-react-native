# test-react-native
This is a react native app for test


## Installation

- This react native application is made with Expo for ease of development, you only need to run the Yarn install command and then run the yarn start command

- Inside the project folder there is a folder called APIREST this folder has a server that was mounted with rest services and another part with Sockets.
You need to install and run the server in NODEJS installing a database in MSSQL
This is really to show that I have worked with all kinds of projects.

## Comments

- A design pattern or HOC technique is used for the app,

- The version 37 of Expo is used together with React Navigation 5, also for the database expo-sqlite is used, for animations LayoutAnimation is used (typical of React),

- To demonstrate that I manage different Libraries in React, use the Context instead of Redux for the simplicity of the app and its use becomes faster, also use information passage by routes
- All the application is made with functional programming eliminating the react classes that are obsolete, different types of Hooks are used, and finally a thema is used for the themeProvider

- In the. part of databases was used in the posts that were added to favorites


Thanks I stay tuned to the Feedback
